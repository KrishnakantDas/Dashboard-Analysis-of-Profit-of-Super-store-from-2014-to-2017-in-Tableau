The Tableau project visualizes profits across various dimensions: year-wise, category-wise, subcategory-wise, region-wise, and state-wise.
It includes a line and bar chart to track profit vs discount trends, bar charts to show top N states by profit, and a map to visualize state-wise profits.
Pie charts highlight the proportion of year wise and shipment wise profits.
The dashboard is designed to provide comprehensive insights into profit distribution, helping to identify growth areas and underperforming segments.
Summary metrics at the top offer a quick overview of overall profitability.
